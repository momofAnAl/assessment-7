Timing Information:
-------------------

Extra Large Array
-----------------
Time to run code with push(): 2.545292 ms
Time to run code with unshift(): 622.975041 ms

Large Array
-----------
Time to run code with push(): 367 μs
Time to run code with unshift(): 5.307 ms

Medium Array
------------
Time to run code with push(): 73.333 μs
Time to run code with unshift(): 110.334 μs

Small Array
-----------
Time to run code with push(): 49.625 μs
Time to run code with unshift(): 19.833 μs

Tiny Array
----------
Time to run code with push(): 41.375 μs
Time to run code with unshift(): 13.625 μs

The times are presented in different units: milliseconds (ms) and microseconds (μs). 
Microseconds are a smaller unit of time than milliseconds.
it seems that push() is faster than unshift() for all array sizes.
This is because push() adds elements to the end of the array, 
which typically requires less computational effort compared to 
adding elements to the beginning of the array (unshift()).

As the array size increases, the time taken for both operations 
(push() and unshift()) also increases.
For smaller arrays (Small Array and Tiny Array), 
the time differences between push() and unshift() are relatively small compared to larger arrays.
For Extra Large Array,  the performance gap between using push() and unshift() is 
most noticeable or significant.
